## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap 5
- SCSS
- Javascript


### What I learned
Starting with the grid system would probably have made achieving this layout easier than going back and adding it after I created the HTML skeleton. I tend to use Bootstrap as an afterthought as opposed to building the page with Bootstrap at the same time. This is likely because I got into the habit of creating a skeleton with HTML then going back and styling with CSS or SCSS.

Hover states for SVG icons. I had hoped there was a simple solution for this, but I found that the simplest solution made my HTML really cluttered. I plan to look into SVGs a bit more to understand them better.

I prefer to write my own CSS/SCSS for some things. It seems more efficient to add a class and adjust the style through that than to add individual styling classess to each HTML element.


### Challenges
- The navbar - Normally with CSS or SCSS, I have no issues with navbars, however I really struggled to get the navigation right here. The disconnected mobile navigation was tricky. When I found a solution for mobile, it made the desktop navbar look broken. I also had issues with the padding and positioning to the mobile navigation list. Currently it's added after the list opens causing the content to jump making the effect jarring.

Navbar still has a lot of issues:
- On screens of 1024px, it looks very cluttered
- Have not managed to fix the jumping when the mobile nav is opened
- When mobile nav is closed, the navlist reverts to being attached to the navbar and closes


### Continued development
- Use the grid system for more complex layouts
- SVGs: styling, etc.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://www.example.com) - This is my go to resource for syntax and trying to understand new concepts
- [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) - I was able to use the docs less during this project, but still a very necessary resource
